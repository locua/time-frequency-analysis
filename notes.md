# SESSION ica notes

- m_01_01, ica's to remove less obvious (?), 0, 1, 2 removed only
- m_02_01, first few ica's are strange...? see screenshots
- m_02_02, pos2a 103 stim (50) events in the raw eeg events 
  - ALSO: why don't the timestamps for the stim and other events in the raw data match with the csv ones??? :/
- m_04_01, raw data for posner a and b looks very noisey
